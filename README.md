# Document-Classification-using-Transformers
In this project Document Classification is done using very effective and efficient model known as LayoutLM(from Transformers). From the documents(scanned images) text data is extracted using Optical Character Recognition(OCR). This information and document layout information is then used for scanned documents classification. Most models used for Natural Language Processing (NLP) task exclusively focus on text information, while neglecting layout of Document on the other hand LayoutLM uses text as well ass layout/style information to classify document. LayoutLM is in Pytorch. Due to copyrights from organisation i am not writing much information about the project as well as Dataset.This project is only base/part of another advance project we are working on. A very small part of original Dataset is used to test the implementation and performance of our model.
